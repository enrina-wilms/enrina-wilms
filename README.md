### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**enrina-wilms/enrina-wilms** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working to improve my design skills and wanter to be a UI/UX designer or Product designer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Interactive Media Design at Seneca College
- âš¡ Fun fact: I rather stay up super late than waking up early, But I'm trying ot be a normal person now and wake at 8am everyday. \m/
